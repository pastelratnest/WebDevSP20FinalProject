            <p>Matt Clepper is a photographer and visual artist (<em>only</em>, for the sake of making this project brief!) born in Dallas and based in Chicago. Working in both analog and digital formats, they seek to bridge the gap between phenomena and feeling by framing the world and its happenings in a distinctly personal context. Taking inspiration from the impressionists of the late 19th and early 20th century, their work is concerned less with intricate detail and more with simply taking that which surrounds them in their everyday life and reducing it down to its purest emotional makeup â€” thus turning the outside inward, and vice versa.</p>
